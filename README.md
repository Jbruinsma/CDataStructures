# C++ Data Structures

This repository contains my personal implementations of core data structures in C++. The goal is to learn how these structures work at a low level — including memory management, pointer manipulation, and performance considerations — by building them from scratch.

While higher-level languages like Python and Java abstract away much of the underlying mechanics, C++ requires explicit control over memory and pointers. This makes it an ideal language to deeply understand how data structures actually work.

##  Structures Implemented so far

- **LinkedList** – Generic doubly linked list built using templates

## Key Features

- Fully generic structures using templates
- Manual memory management (`new`, `delete`)
